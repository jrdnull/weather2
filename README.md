weather2
========

weather2 provides easy access to the [Weather2](http://www.myweather2.com) api, to use this 
api you must sign up for a key and agree to the terms of service which can be done [here](http://www.myweather2.com/developer/).

The 7 day forecast is limited to one global location by using a reference to a location which can be generated in 
the Developer Zone of your account.

Installation
------------

With Go 1 and git installed:

    go get github.com/jrdnull/weather2

This will download, compile, and install the package into your `$GOROOT`
directory hierarchy. Alternatively, you can import it into a
project:

    import "github.com/jrdnull/weather2"

and when you build that project with `go build`, it will be
downloaded and installed automatically.

Usage
-----

To get the two day forecast for 90210, with the temp in celcius and wind speed in miles per hour:
```go
client, err := weather2.NewClient("6-f827v6vb", weather2.CELCIUS, weather2.MILES_PER_HOUR)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
}

weather, err := client.Get2DayForecast("90210")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
} else {
	fmt.Println(weather)
}
```
